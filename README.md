## About

In this project I am analysing the correlation between the availability of agricultural land and various aspects. Namely, Armed Forces Size, Labor force, and physicians per thousand. I am also analysing the correlation between the availability of agricultural land and GDP

The analysis process is as follows:

1. **Data Examination**, Examining the data checking for null values and general shape of data
2. **Data Analysis**, Analyzing data, mainly the distribution followed by examining correlation
3. **Conclusion**, Drawing conclusions based on analysis.
